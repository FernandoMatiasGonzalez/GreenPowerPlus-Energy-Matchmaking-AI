# GP+ | AI-Powered Clean Energy Matchmaking (Prototype)

This is a public-facing prototype for the **Green Power Plus (GP+)** platform.

---

### Project Overview

**GP+** is a rule-based AI agent that interprets natural language queries, extracts structured parameters, and dynamically matches users with clean energy vendors within a scalable, AI-assisted framework. It leverages **predefined logic and an LLM-powered engine** to process user input and return tailored results based on key criteria such as **capacity, financing, certifications, battery storage, location**, and **installation timeline**.

While currently operating on deterministic rules, the system establishes the foundation for future **learning agents**, by structuring user interactions, vendor data, and decision logic for dynamic adaptation and reinforcement.

### Key Features (Prototype Phase)

- Natural language input (LLM-powered)
- Structured data extraction
- Vendor matching based on rule logic
- React-based user interface
- Flask backend with PostgreSQL

---

### Project Structure

- `frontend/` â€“ Simplified React UI for user input and results  
- `backend/` â€“ Flask API that handles query parsing and rule-based matching  
- `docs/` â€“ Visual materials or diagrams for demo/pitch purposes
